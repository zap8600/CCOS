# CCOS
A barely developed OS.

## Why did I create it?
When I started making this, I was coding it as a 16-bit Real Mode assembly. I wasn't that great at assembly because I mainly use C. Eventually, I wanted to make it in C. At the time, I didn't think that 64-bit processors could run 16-bit code, so I wanted to make it 32-bit. I searched for a while, but couldn't find any information. But when I was about to give up, I found someone on Github called [cfenollosa](https://github.com/cfenollosa).
To be finished.
