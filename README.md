# Cotton Candy OS (CCOS)
A barely developed OS.

## Why did I create it?
When I started making this, I was coding it as a 16-bit Real Mode assembly. I wasn't that great at assembly because I mainly use C. Eventually, I wanted to make it in C. At the time, I didn't think that 64-bit processors could run 16-bit code, so I wanted to make it 32-bit. I searched for a while, but couldn't find any information. But when I was about to give up, I found someone on Github called [cfenollosa](https://github.com/cfenollosa) with [this tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial) that was exactly what I needed. At the time, I wasn't able to start building, so I studied it. Eventually, I was able to start.

## Features
* 32-bit Protected Mode
* Command Line
* Keyboard Input
* VGA Graphics
* *kmalloc()* Requesting

## Features yet to be added
* PC Speaker
* Sound Blaster 16
* Hard Drive R/W
* File System
* Userspace
* Text Editor
* Running Apps
* Playing Media
* Etc.

### My current problem
Right now, I'm having trouble finding out how to R/W data to a hard drive. If you have any information that could help me, please email zapost86@gmail.com and zapost@chickasha.k12.ok.us

Thanks!
